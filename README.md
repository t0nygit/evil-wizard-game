## What I Learned

This project helped me practice important Python concepts:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Created classes for different character types
Used inheritance so all characters share common features
Each class has its own methods and attributes

Python Features Used:
- Classes and Objects - Character, Warrior, Mage, Archer, Paladin, EvilWizard
- Inheritance - All character classes inherit from the base Character class
- Methods - Functions inside classes like attack(), heal(), display_stats()
- Random Module - Used random.randint() for variable damage
- Conditional Statements - if/elif/else for game choices and logic
- While Loops - Main battle loop continues until someone wins
- Input/Output - Getting user choices and displaying game information
- String Formatting - Displaying health, damage, and game messages
